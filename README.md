## Overview

Data deduplication is a critical process in data cleaning, which involves identifying and removing duplicate records from a dataset. This repository provides an implementation that efficiently finds exact duplicate entries in large datasets using a hash table approach, which ensures an O(n) time complexity.

## Features

- Efficiently handle large datasets with millions of entries.
- Identify exact duplicates using hash tables.
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation.
- Performance evaluation using precision, recall, and F1 score.
